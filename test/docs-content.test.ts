/**
 * Doc/code-agreement gate. Every TypeScript and JavaScript sample on a hand-written page of
 * `docs-content/` is extracted and executed, its inline `// =>` assertions are checked, and every
 * TypeScript sample is compiled against the package's types, so a documented example can never
 * silently drift from the shipped code (the documentation analog of the conformance runners). A
 * block tagged ` ```ts runnable throws ` must throw. A sample that cannot run says why in its fence
 * (` ```ts no-run <reason> `), and the test below the suite refuses a sample that does neither.
 *
 * The pages under `docs-content/api/` are generated from the TSDoc comments in `src/`, and their
 * `@example` blocks are fragments written for an editor's tooltip, so they are not part of this
 * suite: only the top-level pages are passed in.
 *
 * Snippets import the package the way a consumer does: against the **built** ESM artifact, not the
 * source tree. The harness executes each block as a standalone ES module, so it can't resolve the
 * source's internal `.js`→`.ts` imports; the bundled `dist/index.mjs` is self-contained and is also
 * exactly what an installer loads. The shared CI gate runs `test` before `build`, so we provision
 * `dist/` on demand here rather than assuming build order.
